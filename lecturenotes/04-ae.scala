Arithmetic expressions with variables
=====================================

Let us now consider an extension of the arithmetic expression language with variables. We do this by a new kind of expression, which we call Identifier, or Id.

A different (and arguably more 'object-oriented') way to implement this evaluator would be to add an abstract "eval" method to the Exp class and override it in all subclasses, each implementation corresponding to its corresponding case in the pattern match. The choice between these alternatives matters, since they support different dimensions of extensibility.
 
We will mainly use the more functional style using pattern matching, because it matches better to the order in which we present these topics in the lecture. To try the example, we need a sample environment that gives values to the (free) variables in the sample expression. The test environment also illustrates how Scala supports direct definitions of constant maps.

/** 
We will now learn a different way to encode algorithms that operate on expressions (like the evaluator). To this end, we will now use so-called "folds". Folds are well-known for lists, but the concept is more general and applies to arbitrary algebraic data types.

We will present folds in such a style that they resemble visitors as known from the OO design pattern literature. They correspond to so-called "internal visitors" in which the traversal is encoded within the "accept" function.
 
An internal visitor consists of one function for each syntactic construct of the language. It has a type parameter that determines the "return type" of invoking the visitor on an expression. This type parameter is used in all positions in which the original syntax specifies a subexpression.
   
Internal visitors also correspond to a "bottom-up" traversal of the syntax tree. 
*/ 

object Visitors {
  case class Visitor[T](num: Int => T, add: (T,T)=>T)
  // an alternative to this design is to define num and add as abstract methods
  // and then create concrete visitors by subclassing or trait composition.

/** 
The fold function itself applies a visitor to an expression. Note that the recursion is performed in the fold function, hence all visitors are not recursive.
 
Also note that this design enforces that all algorithms specified via this visitor interfaces are compositional by design. This means that the recursion structure of the algorithm corresponds to the recursion structure of the expression. Put in another way, it means that the semantics (in terms of the meta-language) of a composite  expression is determined by the semantics of the subexpressions; the syntax of the subexpressions is irrelevant.

Compositional specifications are particularly nice because they enable "equational reasoning": Subexpressions can be replaced by other subexpressions with the same semantics without changing the semantics of the whole.

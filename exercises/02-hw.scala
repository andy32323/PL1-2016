// Summer term 2015/2016.

// (notes pending)

// HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT
// ===================
//
// Email homework as Scala source file to:
//
//   paolo.giarrusso@uni-tuebingen.de
//
// Work in groups of 1 or 2 students. Send the email CC to the
// other student in your team.
//Submit your solution to this exercise until Tuesday, 3.5., 23:59h
//via email to paolo.giarrusso@uni-tuebingen.de.
//
//
// Put "pl1-hw02" in subject, please
//
// 0. write in the email:
//      - your names
//      - your student ids ("Matrikelnummer")
// 1. add booleans (incl. a conditional statement) to FAE
// 2. change the FAE interpreter to only close over free variables
//
// About task 2: The FAE interpreter from the lecture always puts
// the whole environment in the closure, but it would be enough
// to store the bindings for all free variables of the function.
//
//
// Send question by email to paolo.giarrusso@uni-tuebingen.de
